ChatGPT
BMI stands for Body Mass Index, which is a measure used to assess an individual's body weight relative to their height. It is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters (BMI = weight / height^2). This index provides a simple numeric indicator of a person's body fatness and is commonly used to categorize individuals into different weight categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity.
